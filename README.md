# SQLAlchemy Part 1

# **Blogly**

[Download exercise](https://curric.springboard.com/software-engineering-career-track/default/exercises/flask-blogly.zip)

This is a multi-unit exercise to practice SQLAlchemy with relationships. Each part corresponds to a unit so make sure that you complete one part and then go onto the next unit.

In it, you’ll build “Blogly”, a blogging application.

## **Part One**

### ****Installing Tools****

```bash
(env) $ pip install psycopg2-binary
(env) $ pip install flask-sqlalchemy
```

### ****Create User Model****

![graphviz-ccdc089eca5c082609c66f8dd24492c2d0d3d178.svg](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/ac5e0418-b00c-4630-9e15-e30966971361/graphviz-ccdc089eca5c082609c66f8dd24492c2d0d3d178.svg)

First, create a ***User*** model for SQLAlchemy. Put this in a ***models.py*** file.

It should have the following columns:

- ***id***, an autoincrementing integer number that is the primary key
- ***first_name*** and ***last_name***
- ***image_url*** for profile images

Make good choices about whether things should be required, have defaults, and so on.

### **Create Flask App**

Next, create a skeleton Flask app. You can pattern match from the lecture demo.

It should be able to import the ***User*** model, and create the tables using SQLAlchemy. Make sure you have the FlaskDebugToolbar installed — it’s especially helpful when using SQLAlchemy.

### **Make a Base Template**

Add a base template with slots for the page title and content. Your other templates should use this.

You can use Bootstrap for this project, but don’t spend a lot of time worrying about styling — this is **not** a goal of this exercise.

### **User Interface**

Here is what you should build:

1. **User Listing**

1. **New User Form**

1. **User Detail Page**

1. **User Edit Page**

### **Make Routes For Users**

<aside>
💡 **Note: We Won’t Be Adding Authentication.** While this appliction will have “users”, we’re not going to be building login/logout, passwords, or other such thing in this application. Any visitor to the site should be able to see all users, add a user, or edit any user.

</aside>

**Make routes for the following:**

**GET */ :*** Redirect to list of users. (We’ll fix this in a later step).

**GET */users :*** Show all users. Make these links to view the detail page for the user. Have a link here to the add-user form.

**GET */users/new :*** Show an add form for users

**POST */users/new :*** Process the add form, adding a new user and going back to ***/users***

**GET */users/[user-id] :***Show information about the given user. Have a button to get to their edit page, and to delete the user.

**GET */users/[user-id]/edit :*** Show the edit page for a user. Have a cancel button that returns to the detail page for a user, and a save button that updates the user.

**POST */users/[user-id]/edit :***Process the edit form, returning the user to the ***/users*** page.

**POST */users/[user-id]/delete :*** Delete the user.

### **Add Testing**

Add python tests to at least 4 of your routes.

## **Part One: Further Study**

There are two more big parts to this exercise—but if you feel like you’re ahead of the group, here is some further study for this part you can work on.

### **Add Full Name Method**

It’s likely that you refer to users by `{{ user.first_name }} {{ user.last_name }}` in several of your templates. This is mildly annoying to have to keep writing out, but a big annoyance awaits: what would happen if you added, say, a ***middle_name*** field? You’d have to find & fix this in every template.

Better would be to create a convenience method, ***get_full_name()***, which you could use anywhere you wanted the users’ full name:

```sql
>>> u = User.query.first()

>>> u.first_name    # SQLAlchemy attribute
'Jane'

>>> u.last_name     # SQLAlchemy attribute
'Smith'

>>> u.get_full_name()
'Jane Smith'
```

Write this.

Change your templates and routes to use this.

### **List Users In Order**

Make your listing of users order them by ***last_name***, ***first_name***.

You can have SQLAlchemy do this—you don’t need to do it yourself in your route.

### **Turn Full Name Into a “Property”**

Research how to make a Python “property” on a class — this is something that is *used like* an attribute, but actually is a method. This will let you do things like:

```sql
>>> u = User.query.first()

>>> u.first_name    # SQLAlchemy attribute
'Jane'

>>> u.last_name     # SQLAclhemy attribute
'Smith'

>>> u.full_name     # "property"
'Jane Smith'
```
